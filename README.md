## Summary
This data shows how popular a bike sharing service can be in a large city. Areas of interest for bike stations should be places considered to have a high tourist turnout and areas with a large number of businesses. With the short duration of rides subscriptions may the best area of profit. Users that subscribe to Citi bike are much more likely to use the service. Pushing for subscribers early on may be a good idea. This could be accomplished through early promotion to try out the service through subscription. As can be seen in New York, men seem more likely to use the service. This may leave an untapped market of women who could use the service. Promotions towards women may prove beneficial when first starting up. Overall this data shows great opportunity for bike share in a large city like Des Moines.
